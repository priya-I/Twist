Page:14*count:5-->Total net yards: Cleveland 151, Baltimore  283
Page:14*count:6-->Anquan Boldin is putting on a clinic. #trueproreceiver
Page:14*count:7-->Boldin + Pitta = Combined 1 catch, 6 yards in the first half.
Page:14*count:8-->These teams have combined for 60 rushing yards tonight (34 for Cle., 26 for Bal.)
Page:14*count:9-->Ravens are 1 of 6 on third down conversions tonight. Browns are 2 of 7.
Page:14*count:10-->Great drive by Weeden and the Browns. Shows what can be when receivers hold onto the ball.
Page:14*count:11-->@jonheheman Same for Julio Jones.
Page:14*count:12-->@jonheheman Green was great last year and is again. Smith wasn't but is now.
Page:14*count:13-->@MichaelProcton Certainly on the plus side.
Page:14*count:14-->"And Little doesn't drop that one"
Page:14*count:15-->Tucker, Walsh, Zuerlein are all having great rookie years so far. Nobody kicking better.
Page:14*count:16-->That security guard got very lucky there.
Page:14*count:17-->Torrey Smith may be the best of a large group of second-year players who are miles better this year than last.
Page:14*count:18-->Back-to-back great throw/catches for Flacco and Doss/Smith.
Page:14*count:19-->So far this game is not a Greg Little highlight film. He needs a big play.
Page:14*count:20-->Flacco picked off in the end zone. Good play by Craig Robertson but bad decision by Flacco.
Page:14*count:21-->Great news that Cribbs was able to get up and walk off under his own power.
Page:14*count:22-->Brutal hit on Joshua Cribbs on a punt return, knocking his helmet clear off. He's still down on the turf.
Page:14*count:23-->Three linebackers: Kevin Hardy (Jags), John Mobley (Broncos), and Reggie Brown (Lions)  were selected before Ray Lewis in the 1996 draft.

Page:14*count:25-->Only the Lions (.318) have a lower winning percentage than the Browns (.322) since the start of 1999.
Page:14*count:26-->How many LB's were taken in the 1996 draft before Ray Lewis? Can you name them? #Ravens
Page:14*count:27-->@JHScramble correct.
Page:14*count:28-->What's the only team with a lower winning percentage than the Browns (.322) since the franchise's return to the NFL in 1999?
Page:14*count:29-->Now that the officials are back, can we do something to negotiate away that Cee-Lo intro on NFL Network's coverage?

Page:14*count:33-->Ravens hold a 19-7 edge over Browns winning the last 8 meetings. B'more's avg winning margin over the last 8  is 14 points (25.4 to 11.4)
