Question: Where do you rank Alex Smith among NFL quarterbacks?

The QB on the cover of SI four years ago this week? Brett Favre. As a Jet: http://t.co/pOjKsozd
So what did you think of the day in the NFL? Here's some Snap Judgments from @DonBanks: http://t.co/2C0FEP1L
@Big_John_1906 I only lumped with Gostkowski's miss today. Been tracking amazing accuracy for K's this week. Not looking back at all.
@Big_John_1906 Not dinging him. It was a potential game-tying kick. He missed. So critical. They were better off throwing a hail mary.
Tracking FGs all day. Before that there was one. Now there are two. 46 for 48 for the week so far. Amazing accuracy. Long misses count too.
And Shanahan obviously thought Cundiff had a chance in a dome or he would've had RG3 throw into the end zone. He had someone kick a 63yarder
Not placing blame...it was a critical kick and just the second miss on the day.
Billy Cundiff makes it two critical FG misses.
London Fletcher is one of the most underrated players in the league. Before today he had 211 more tackles than anyone else in last 10yrs.
@Bueller27 Amazingly, yes. So far.
Kicker ticker: 46 of 47 on FGs (97.9%), 71 for 71 in XPs so far this week.
@RaulCamarena It all depends on how Gates' ribs are this week. Rosario's had games like this before then disappeared later.
You've heard it before but it's being proven again today. Seattle is a very difficult place to visit and win. #12thman
@RaulCamarena I feel for you. Again, we had the right idea.
That was a fantastic catch by Mike Wallace. Darrelle Revis wouldn't have been able to defend that one either.
Marshawn Lynch is in Beast Mode. Chewing up the rushing yards against Dallas.
Home teams are 8-2 so far this week and winning three of the four late games. Only losses: New England and Jacksonville.
RT @NFLhistory: Jason Witten is now 3rd TE in #NFL history (Gonzalez, Sharpe) & 2nd #Cowboys player (Irvin) with 700 career catches
@TheMitchSports Have to wait until the end of Monday Night's game.
Wow, was Leonard Hankerson was wide open on that long TD from RGIII. The Redskins are rolling again.
Nicks and Cruz: 21 catches, 379 yards 2 TDs.
Kicker ticker...they're 39 of 40 on FGs and and 60 of 60 on XPs this week. And the only miss lost a game.
@RaulCamarena We had the right idea...just picked the wrong replacement.
An example of why Alfred Morris will stick: immediately follows up a long run with solid blitz pickup.
@AlbanyHDTV I owed you one...
Eli Manning's 510 passing yards tied Drew Brees for the 7th -best in league history and three yards behind Phil Simms for most for the NYG
Incredible stat: Since the start of December, 2011 the Cardinals have the NFL's best regular season record (7-1).
The ebbs and flows of the early games today have been extraordinary.
Can we please work harder to end this replacement referee insanity?
RT @tisportsguy: @SInow 43% of my survivor pool just got knocked out.
How many folks were knocked out of their survivor pool with that Gostkowski miss?
The first missed field goal of the day throughout the league sinks the Patriots.
That Ryan Williams fumble was unacceptable. Shades of the Miracle at the Meadowlands.
Kerry Rhodes makes the play of the day against Gronkowski, keeping the Cardinals on top of the Pats.
There are some nail-biters going on right now in the NFL.
@RaulCamarena I'd use McM
@RaulCamarena Yes, McMichael.
Not many receivers are as dangerous deep down the sidelines as Victor Cruz.
#SITweetWeek begins tomorrow, where SI dedicates a whole week to Twitter. Who are YOUR favorite #WAGS on Twitter?
Ben Tate scores his second TD of the day and also had one reversed by replay.
Reggie Bush is putting on a rushing exhibition right now.
Through six quarters Greg Schiano is the NFL's coach of the year, by a landslide.
Kicker ticker: 20 of 20 in FGs, 25 of 25 in XPs this week so far.
We're not going to see Ahmad Bradshaw or Domenik Hixon again today.
This is the Cam Newton we saw last year. Running, throwing. Driving his team.
The NFL's offensive MVP through six quarters? C.J. Spiller.
@SInow Last week and GB-Chi that is...
This is getting a little crazy. Kickers are 15 of 15 in FG attempts today after going 71 for 76 last week.
Vincent Jackson scores his first TD as a Buc.
@copywritinggirl No judgement, just fact.
Vonta Leach vultures a potential Ray Rice TD.
Eli Manning is hitting his receivers in the hands but they're just not catching the ball.
I get the feeling that Dwayne Allen is going to catch his fair share of Andrew Luck TDs.
If you think Michael Vick's 5 ints. in 5 quarters is rough, mull this: George Blanda threw 10 ints. in the Oilers first two games of 1962.
Adam (Pacman) Jones is now second among all active players with 5 punt return TDs. Only Devin Hester (12) has more.
@lukayygreen Johnson and Jackson
@tristan0010 Pettigrew
@Renner_Nickle Wallace especially with Revis out.
@lukayygreen sit Williams
@Adm1023 DHB
@Packfns San Francisco every week no matter who the opponent.
@1stevem23 Cowboys vs. Wilson.
@Jeff_Mezzatesta RGIII. Ravens will figure Vick out, contain him.
@Adm1023 A lot? Doubtful. Some, yes. I like Floyd better.
@Packfns Very close. I like Rivers slightly more this week.
@wilkentj I'd use Tate. The Texans usually run all over the Jags.
@dextroxity19 But I'll also submit it to the panel
@dextroxity19 I'd look to improve on one starter (WR/RB/TE) for him. One more big game (like today vs. Rams?) and I'd pull the trigger.
@hollywoodheffne Too risky. Was so bad last week that if Stewart shows anything, he'll play a lot.
@ichadlowe Maclin.
@KuNFuZe I would think so especially since he'll continue to climb the list with Luck at QB.
@lbush34 Chris Johnson.

Chuck's website says "Paula Nick" Also says Old World pronunciation is "PAH-la-nyook"
RT @AlexBarrera_: @AroundTheHorn A+ for pronouncing 'Palahniuk' correctly!
RT @tripproy: @AroundTheHorn the author's name is pronounced "pa-LON-yuk" not "PAL-an-yuk" #ChuckPalahniuk
You rank the way people pronounce his name? RT @transatlantia worst pronunciation of chuck palahniuk's name I've ever heard.
Or as @Bruce_Arthur just pointed out, Wilson might have said "I'm an oracle" Either way, full frontal beard fearing if he ever wants to Horn
Brian Wilson just call Renteria's MVP "adorable."   Open invitation for him on Around the Horn.  Fact.
Few things in the world I love more than ISO cams on the final pitch. Huff hucking his mitt at the mound.  Lince jumping the railing.
Panda getting vertical!
And there it is!  The 'it's been so long since... We have to tell you how much gas was' graphic.
Line I couldn't squeeze into a script today, 'Mike Shanahan? More like Mike Tanahan.  Did he go as Pauly D from Jersey Shore for Halloween?'
Um, we did.  Last Friday.  RT @alexthapar  Please have Cowlishaw do an entire show as Al Davis...classic!
5 minutes til @BillPlaschke @TimCowlishaw @ProfBlackistone @MrMichael_Smith get loud. Moss, Favre, McBenched, FakePunt, Oregon, World Series
Quite possibly the most perfect thing we've ever done http://twitpic.com/320281 @PTIshow
That's about as good as we can do it.  Right there with the backwards episode on April Fool's Day. Thanks to Bill, Tim, Kev & Mike
RT @Schmidty85: @Aroundthehorn when @ProfBlackistone took off his rangers hat he looked like galager
I could hear Al Davis say "Kinsler" all day.  Phenomenal job out of @TimCowlishaw and @ProfBlackistone staying in character
And this is KB's first shapeup in 20 years http://twitpic.com/31ysjs @ProfBlackistone
Words can't describe how awesome this is http://twitpic.com/31yt60 @ProfBlackistone #UncleRon #GeorgeJefferson
T Minus 10 minutes until our Halloween Extravaganza http://twitpic.com/31yt60  He who stays in character longest wins.
A+ @SportsNation
RT @ProfBlackistone: 10 of 46 teams losing first two World Series games on road have come back to win it all. That ratio is surprisingly ...
RT @seancarp: @AroundtheHorn suggested headline for tomorrow? "Walk Him, Texas Ranger"
"Thank you for being a friend."  Woof.  I wouldn't post a joke like that with B. Arthur's twitter page. @bruce_arthur
Only said it to get a reax out of oldies on panel & got nothing. & even less reax for Growing Pains RT @jscott223  ELO stuck in my head now
To Arthur! RT @bruce_arthur Canadian content on @AroundTheHorn coming within hours. Question: Will I wear my ceremonial beaverskin jacket?
Is Blake Griffin gonna have to break a rim?  He looks violent.
Kyle Korver just blocked the shot of Russell Westbrook. That's freakier than a Lady Pyramid.
And as surprising as Cavs over the Celtics is, Lee out in the 5th with 5 across even more shocking.
RT @miketoole: Celtics beat the Heat. Cavs beat the Celtics. Therefore, the Cavs are the best team in the league. It's simple math, people.
