Dufner over Hanson tying the #RyderCup at 13.
It's safe to say that Alfred Morris is solidly the Redskins top running back. I wouldn't look for anyone to overtake him anytime soon.
There was such dread while watching Jim Furyk agonize over his final putt. #painful
Westwood over Kuchar 3&2. Garcia over Furyk. Europe 13, USA 12.
Of the five remaining matches USA leads in two, Europe leads two, one is all square.
Zach Johnson defeats Graeme McDowell 2 & 1 giving the USA a 12-11 lead. #RyderCup
USA Anchorman Tiger Woods' putt on 13 gives him a 1 point lead over Molinari. #RyderCup
Pierre Garcon credited with TD after RG3 fumbles at the goalline. #onlymattersinfantasy
Ed Hochuli is working the Jags-Bengals game. He spent time this week with Steve Rushin. Read what he had to say in the next issue of SI.
Pennant Chase: Yankees, Orioles both win, remain tied in AL East. Angels stay alive in playoff hunt on 2-R double by Torri Hunter.
Justin Rose's birdie on 18 sinks Phil Mickelson, ties #RyderCup at 11 all.
Dustin Johnson's 3 & 2 win puts the USA up 11-10 #RyderCup
Lawrie, McIlroy and Poulter all win, squaring up #RyderCup at 10.
Incredible scoring drive by the Falcons to take the lead with 5 sec left. Started with Ryan to Roddy White 60yard pass play ends w FG Bryant
Fantastic coverage by the Panthers punt coverage team.
@applusathletics @Patriots Yup. And my fact has Vegas Ferguson. Set. Match ;)
@applusathletics @successtrace two sources (Statspass, Pro-football-reference) that dispute that. Both say van Eeghen only had 82 that game
@TheyCallMeDeal I got it from two different sources. Van Eeghen didn't even have 100 scrim. yards so not a case of run vs. pass play.
@TheyCallMeDeal That game I got Tony Collins (103) Mark van Eeghen (82).
The last time the Pats had two 100-yard rushers in a game was 11/23/1980  Don Calhoun and Vegas Ferguson. #Patriots
Luke Donald def. Bubba Watson 2 and 1. USA 10, Europe 7
Triple Crown watch: Miguel Cabrera 0-2.
Rushing TD for Cam Newton. 6 carries for 64 yards on the ground so far.

@Romuthewizard Ray Rice led on Thursday with 49 yards.
@aguado91 just passed.
The week's leading rusher as of right now? Chris Johnson, 65 yards.
@robinja01 Yup. 60, 58, 56.  Only Jeff Wilkins' 57 is in the way.
Big 60-yard TD catch for Michael Turner on a short center screen. It was the longest catch of Turner's career. The previous long? 32-yards.

Scary sight seeing Vince Wilfork come out of a goalline pile trying to run with the ball.
Jamaal Charles is so slippery. Tough to get a hold of him even when it seems you have him stopped.
Steven Jackson into the end zone but laundry calls it back for a 10-yard holding penalty.
Playoff peek: Orioles lead Red Sox; Blue Jays lead Yankees. Rangers lead the Angels in Gm 1.
@Hurley_Jeffrey Impossible situation. I wouldn't have done any better. But thankfully we don't have to worry about it anymore.
#RyderCup update: Europe leads three matches, the U.S.A. leads in two. Others all square.
@Hurley_Jeffrey IMO There were an inordinate no. of questionable calls and insufferably long delays to try to get them right. Glad it's over
Speaking of officials: Check out this upcoming Sports Illustrated for Steve Rushin's look at everyone's favorite ref, Ed Hochuli.
@DarioKing Absolutely. No more 4 hour regulation games, please.
The best part of the officials return: You trust that referees  like Mike Carey are making a call they know is correct. No guessing.
Colin Kaepernick's Wildcat > Tim Tebow's Wildcat.
Chargers RB Jackie Battle scores against his former mates, killing Ryan Mathews fantasy owners in the process.
@DarioKing true but he was terrible from start to finish last week.
Rookie Greg Zuerlein hit a 58-yard FG vs. Seattle. That's the longest in Rams team history. He also owns the third longest too. #GregtheLeg
@Dennis_Glade @dglade Not good by any means but he still threw for 303 yards in the loss.
Cam Newton showing last week v.s NYG was just a hiccup.
Greg Olsen is having a really good season so far. Fantasy bargain.
That drive was all too easy for Matt Schaub and the Texans.
Percy Harvin goes all the way with the opening kickoff against Detroit. 105 yards. #purespeed

@RaulCamarena Ponder...Gates...BJGE...FJax
@PaulWallofFame PPR
@PaulWallofFame If it's a PR league I'd use Forte. If not, Tate should get plenty of action.
@Jeff_Mezzatesta I'd sit Dez.

Really? Bernard Pierce (48) has more rushing yards than Trent Richardson (47) tonight.
8 catches for 125 yards in the 2nd half for Boldin.
@RedRum26 with his head.
No. 1 receivers make that catch.
@CJErie yup. Hodges still unblemished.
@B_R_West exactly. Hodges still holding up though.
Hodges has punted 7 times tonight with 1 return for 0 yards. Koch has punted 5 times with 1 return for 14 yards #effectivepunting
Richardson 14-47, Rice 13-46
Rushing first downs tonight: Ravens 5, Browns 1
Cleveland's longest run tonight is seven yards (Richardson)
Cary Williams 63-yard pick six. Scores untouched down the sideline. 23-10 Baltimore.
RT @theScore: RT @theScoreNFL: Here is the Josh Cribbs hit everyone is talking about: http://t.co/sCiiQ959 #NFL
Total net yards: Cleveland 151, Baltimore  283
Anquan Boldin is putting on a clinic. #trueproreceiver
Boldin + Pitta = Combined 1 catch, 6 yards in the first half.
These teams have combined for 60 rushing yards tonight (34 for Cle., 26 for Bal.)
Ravens are 1 of 6 on third down conversions tonight. Browns are 2 of 7.
Great drive by Weeden and the Browns. Shows what can be when receivers hold onto the ball.
@jonheheman Same for Julio Jones.
@jonheheman Green was great last year and is again. Smith wasn't but is now.
@MichaelProcton Certainly on the plus side.
"And Little doesn't drop that one"
Tucker, Walsh, Zuerlein are all having great rookie years so far. Nobody kicking better.
That security guard got very lucky there.
Torrey Smith may be the best of a large group of second-year players who are miles better this year than last.
Back-to-back great throw/catches for Flacco and Doss/Smith.
So far this game is not a Greg Little highlight film. He needs a big play.
Flacco picked off in the end zone. Good play by Craig Robertson but bad decision by Flacco.
Great news that Cribbs was able to get up and walk off under his own power.
Brutal hit on Joshua Cribbs on a punt return, knocking his helmet clear off. He's still down on the turf.
Three linebackers: Kevin Hardy (Jags), John Mobley (Broncos), and Reggie Brown (Lions)  were selected before Ray Lewis in the 1996 draft.
In the same span (1999 to now) the Ravens have the NFL’s sixth-best record 126-85 (.597).
Only the Lions (.318) have a lower winning percentage than the Browns (.322) since the start of 1999.
How many LB's were taken in the 1996 draft before Ray Lewis? Can you name them? #Ravens
@JHScramble correct.
What's the only team with a lower winning percentage than the Browns (.322) since the franchise's return to the NFL in 1999?
Now that the officials are back, can we do something to negotiate away that Cee-Lo intro on NFL Network's coverage?
Jonathan Ogden was BAL's first pick (4th overall) in '96 and among 13 1st-time nominees for the PF Hall of Fame class of '13 announced today
Who was the first player drafted by the Baltimore Ravens franchise?
Cleveland enters this game 0-3 and in danger of starting 0-4 for the 3rd time. The first 2 were in '99-the 1st year back in the NFL-and '09.
Ravens hold a 19-7 edge over Browns winning the last 8 meetings. B'more's avg winning margin over the last 8  is 14 points (25.4 to 11.4)
@jeff_halaparda Exactly one.
Which team are you most excited about seeing tonight?   a) Browns b) Ravens c) real NFL officials

@wcf8089 Ridley. Pats will be able to move the ball against the now very familiar Ravens.
@JoshBrawdy Better off taking the touchback and the time.
Not a wise return there, Eric Decker.
This is the 12th time the Saints have started a season 0-3 and the second time with Drew Brees at QB (2007).
@AlbanyHDTV Exactly. No receiving TD.
Antonio Brown's fantasy owners can breathe a sigh of relief after that recovery.
@ChrisBurke_SI It was a dead ball following a spike.
Vicious hit by Joe Mays on Matt Schaub, sending his helmet flying.

The Arizona Cardinals believe right now. A Kerry Rhodes sack leads to a 93-yard fumble return for James Sanders to end the first half 24-0.
Matt Schaub's deep ball is ON today.
The late Steve Sabol would've had a field day documenting  today's zany action.
It's time to lock the representatives for the league and the referees in a room and not let them out until there's a resolution to this mess
Craziest game of the year between the Lions and Titans. Titus Young just caught a Hail Mary for a TD.
Incredible defensive play by Titans Alterraun Verner, ripping the ball away from Brandon Pettigrew before running it back for a TD.
@CarverGow Corrected. League had him active but team had him inactive. He's inactive.
Correction: Mendenhall is out. Listed by league as active but by team as out.
It's good to see that Jamaal Charles got his speed back. Great run up the sidelines for a long TD.
If nothing else, the RG3-led Redskins are very entertaining.
TD Brees to Jimmy Graham.

Of the 55 run plays against the Packers 33 have gained at least 4 yards, the highest pct. in the league. Seattle's D at just 25% (9 of 36)
The Eagles have already given away the ball nine times. The Falcons and Texans have yet to commit a turnover this season.
The Cowboys and Titans are tied for last in the NFL with just five scoring drives this season.
Thanks to @_M__3_ who pointed out that Andrew Luck is also in position to join RG3 in making history for QBs.
@RaulCamarena you too. Good luck.
Robert Griffin III can become the first rookie QB since the merger to start first three games of a season and throw for >200 yds w/TD.
@RaulCamarena 1) Nothing official but it's looking good for Gates. 2) Stick w/Colston. Roberts has tough matchup.
@edwinljohnson All of them are better but it won't last for long. The Niners are an elite team.
@RaulCamarena 3. Lions 4. Redman  5. grab the opener.
@mppodobinski I'd go with Crabtree and Dwyer
@npuccine Nothing official but he should.
Pierre Garcon, Dustin Keller, Rodger Saffold, Fred Jackson, Matt Forte all inactive today.
Maurice Jones-Drew averages 101 yards per game in 12 games  against the Colts, second alltime to Curtis Martin (109.7 over 15 games)
Officially active today: Steven Jackson and Marques Colston.

First half time of possession: Giants 20:02  Panthers 9:58
Total Yards: Giants 303  Panthers 122
So much for the knock that Ramses Barden can't get open: 7 catches for 123 yards in the first half.
@fativerson Bears
The last Giant with more 1st half rushing yards than Brown's 88 was Derrick Ward had 110 on Dec. 2, 2007.
The Giants offense isn't missing a beat with Brown and Barden in for Bradshaw and Nicks.
Martellus Bennett is becoming a scoring machine. Just tied Vernon Davis and Dante Rosario for the TD catch lead with 3 #yearofthetightend
The CRUUUUUZ was so loud on that first pass you'd think this game was in Jersey.
Nice tribute by the NFL tonight (and again at the sites of the remaining 15 games this week) remembering the late Steve Sabol of NFL Films.
Cam Newton has either thrown or run for a touchdown in 17 of his 18 career games. Only the Titans were able to keep him out of the end zone.
Our Manning-Newton debate is evenly split with strong support for both sides.
Among those inactive tonight are Jonathan Stewart, Thomas Davis, Hakeem Nicks, Domenik Hixon, Ahmad Bradshaw, David Diehl Michael Coe.
If you were to start a franchise today, who would you choose as your QB, Eli Manning or Cam Newton?
Since '60 only three RBs have rushed for 4 TDs in a game against NYG: Leroy Kelly CLE '69; Emmitt Smith DAL '95; DeAngelo Williams CAR, '08

The press conference with Tito Vilanova and Andoni Zubizarreta has ended. #FCBLive
Tito: "I know Cesc well. He demands a lot from himself. His second season will be better than the first." #FCBLive
Tito: "Alba has the dream of playing in the Olympics. I understand him. I'm only concerned with the amount of rest he gets." #fcblive
Tito: "I still would prefer to have a smaller squad. The preseason will mark how the rest of the year will go" #FCBLive
Tito: "Hopefully Messi can score just as many goals this year as he did last year! He just improves year after year." #FCBLive
Zubi: "We haven't talked with Puyol about renewing his contract yet. Talks with Mascherano, however, are ongoing and advanced." #FCBLive
Tito: "All of the titles are important. If we can win the Liga or the Champions League, fantastic." #fcblive
Tito: "We've evolved over the past 4 years. I believe that we're at the point where we can change our style of play in the middle of a game"
Live: Tito Vilanova and Andoni Zubizarreta's press conference: http://t.co/ZNUIkIDW [ENG] #fcblive
Tito confirms that the team isn't looking for a new striker because "we don't need one, we already have plenty of good options" #FCBlive
Tito: "Gerard Deulofeu's place, at the moment, is in the Barça B team. We shouldn't rush the issue." #fcblive
Tito, on Alexis: "I'm convinced that he'll be even better this year." #FCBLive
Tito on Villa:"It's been a pleasant surprise. It's noticeable that he's been working hard all summer. He'll be an important player" #fcblive

Tito: "Javi Martínez is the type of player we  are looking for, like a lot of other players. We can't talk about specific players." #FCBLive
Tito: "I'm counting on all of the players that are here. Afellay is a great player that had a serious injury last season." #fcblive
Tito: "This last month I've had great conversations with the players and I took advantage of the time to get some rest #fcblive
Tito: "If we find a player that can play in the center back and pivot role, fantastic. If not, we'll find a player in the reserve team"
Tito: "I want to take the opportunity to thank Keita for the four fantastic years that he's given us" #FCBLive
Andoni: "On August 31st we'll try to have the best possible team. But first we'll look at La Masia (for new signings)" #FCBLive

Throw in the Duke 0-for-the West Region stat and I would have thought somebody would have BOUGHT Zona's chances.   Now they'll pay.
Woody's 'Bus' stat more about miles. Duke's trip 2400 miles more than UA. Team with fewer miles like that wins 79%. SDSU's loss the anomaly
4. 0-4. Small sample set. But also means this is not so familiar territory RT @bgallow2000 how many times has duke lost in the west?
Nice. Get ready to blow your savings on hair gel.  RT @robbridgeforth Reali when I die I want to come back as you.

(Woody picked SDSU because 'teams that take the Bus to the game win' ... Wasn't far off, tms 100 miles from campus win 79%. just not SDSU)

Plaschke,JA, Woody, KB on 5 sec violation, UNC-UW, Butler-PITT & Big Least. The Mute Hand is strong & The Horn overflows! Who ya got?
RT @SethDavisHoops  A player can call a time out up until the ref counts to five. Rule changed several years ago. Apologies
.@SethDavisHoops I hadn't heard of it either.  By my stopwatch whistle still at 4.6 or so, with people yelling TO at 4.2 or so.
Alright @TimCowlishaw says 'well known' but @bubbaprog says it's not in the book http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/BR11.pdf
First I've ever heard of the "No TO after 4 seconds' rule Winer & Co were talking about. Weird. If 5 secs, then you should have 5 secs.
But by rule you can't call timeout after 4 seconds, so it's ok. Then, the foul after the backboard goes red. Every millisecond in play there
Once again, a final 10 seconds beyond comprehension. By my stopwatch here though, the 5 second violation just short of 5 seconds. 4.6 or so.

Poor Plaschke. That's a tough one to lose a Final Four team on.  And now, I let the people decide.  What's Plaschke's punishment?
Halftime scouting of another kind.  Pat Riley is 25 feet away.  It's a hair off.  And I'm losing.

Ok, I'll say it. Putting your own shoes on after wearing bowling shoes for 3 hours is the best feeling you can have with your pants on.
How do 7 spares only equal 147?  This lane is prejudiced against my pink ball. And that I have my oil in my hair than it has in gutter.
Sorry I'm not a good bowler. While everyone was bowling in high school I was busy not going on dates.
My bowl movement has been inconsistent and labored. Oil issues.  Just finished with 139.  23.6 mph.  #HornPTIBowling
Pics will be coming.  Also, if any staffer picks up a split, TK, Wilbon and myself drop a Dougie.
A 151 for Kornheiser.
And this with his backup, backup pair of bowling shoes. 197.  Today, redemption is spelled B-O-N.  #HornPTIBowling #HowWeRoll
And just finished with a 197.  Wes Mallot ain't got nothing on Wil E. Bunz.
Wilbon just bowled 5 strikes in a row
Wilbon bowled a 199 vs. Wes Mallot on national TV.  Tony consistently  in the 130s.  I sometimes break 22 mph.
Horn/PTI Christmas Party is tonight. Bowling. That's how we roll. I'll try to pass along photo of Wil E. Bunz' bowling shirt, TK's snap hook
